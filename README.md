# bmi_bmr_calculator
### As part of a health and fitness application, I developed algorithms for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). These metrics are crucial for assessing individuals' health and fitness levels and helping them set and track goals. Below is an overview of my implementation:
1.BMI Calculation:

Developed a method to calculate BMI based on height and weight inputs.
Provided a result interpretation for BMI to categorize individuals as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

2.BMR Calculation:

Created an algorithm to calculate BMR using the individual's height, weight, and age.
Implemented an interpretation method to provide feedback on the individual's metabolic rate.
Calculated energy requirements for various activity levels (sedentary to very heavy exercise) based on the BMR.

3.UI Integration:

Designed user-friendly interfaces to accept input data such as height, weight, and age.
Provided clear output of BMI and BMR results with appropriate interpretations and feedback.
Included options to recalculate BMI and BMR based on updated inputs.

4.State Management:

Utilized the Bloc pattern for state management to ensure smooth interaction between the UI and calculation logic.
Handled user inputs and calculation results efficiently and accurately.

5.User Experience:

Focused on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for individuals looking to track their health and fitness metrics.
Provided informative feedback to guide users toward healthier choices based on their BMI and BMR results.
